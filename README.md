# FoxPet

Bring foxes into your pet family!
This data pack lets you tame and control foxes as loyal companions in Minecraft. A feature many players have wished for is finally here.

## ⚠️ **Important Information** ⚠️
**⚠️ This is not a native pet system like wolves or cats.
FoxPet is designed to work well in multiplayer, though occasional issues may occur. I'm actively working to fix any bugs!**

**⚠️ A resource pack is required. Please download it manually from the versions page. (Versions -> _your version_ -> Files -> Resource pack)**

**⚠️ Not seeing your version here? Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/arrtixx/FoxPet), maybe it's there.**

## Why as a data pack?
> Data packs are very easy to install and set up

> They're basically cross-platform (since it doesn't matter if you're running Forge, Fabric, Paper, etc.; it will run no matter what you're running)

> They're easier to make compared to mods

> They don't have to be updated a lot - data packs for older or newer versions of Minecraft _can_ be compatible with different versions

## Features
### 🦊 Tame a Fox
To make a fox your pet:

> Craft a Fox Treat

> Throw the treat at a fox

> The fox becomes your pet, and you receive a Sit Stick

### 🪑 Sit and Stand Commands
Throw the Sit Stick at your tamed fox to make it sit.
You'll receive an Unsit Stick in return.
Throw the Unsit Stick to make the fox stand again (you get the Sit Stick back).

### 📯 Call Your Fox
Craft a Fox Whistle to call all your standing foxes to you.
Works without needing to aim at the fox.
Has a 1-second cooldown and infinite durability.

### ❤️ Pet Fox Stats
> 30 health points (for comparison, a tamed wolf has 40)

> Attacks deal 5 damage

> Throwing another Fox Treat at your tamed fox will heal it to full health

### 🎨 Updated Fox Textures
Foxes have a cute new look!
If you're not a fan, feel free to remove or modify the textures in the resource pack. (In the future, I might add a toggle option via ResPackOpts.)
